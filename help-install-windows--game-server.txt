1- Your have defined a username with admin privileges - let's call hime <myuser>... You also have decided of the same password called <mypassword> that you will use for both the redis and the postgresql database servers.
2- install a REDIS database server for windows 
Go to and download at :
https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases

3- change REDIS configuration file to add password:
Go to the Program Files\Redis folder and change redis.windows-service.conf file.
Make sure to uncomment the line with "requirepass" and write down your database password
requirepass <mypassword>

4- restart REDIS :
restart the Redis service (Run -\> services.msc -\> Redis -\> Restart).

5- install the postgresql database server
go to https://www.bigsql.org/postgresql/installers.jsp/ and download the graphical installer.
Just add <mypassword> when prompted (following on site instructions at https://www.bigsql.org/docs/installwindows/installwin)

6- configure postgresql :
Open psql to start working with PostgreSQL. You will see the following:

$ psql -U postgres
psql (9.6beta1)
Type "help" for help"

postgres=#

Create a database:

To create your "wds" database, enter the following:

postgres=# create database wds;
CREATE DATABASE
You can now connect to the database "wds"

postgres=# \c wds;
You are now connected to database "mydb" as user "postgres".
mydb=#

type \q to exit the database command line.

14- go where the serious game folder has been extracted and start installing node.js related stuff:
e.g. cd Documents/myseriousgame/
Go to  https://nodejs.org/en/ and download and install a recent stable version of node.js.
Open a command line and type:
sudo npm install sails -g
sudo npm install forever -g
npm install

15- in the serious game folder, edit 2 files:

config/connections.js

16 - (finally) run the game server.
You can either use:
sudo sails lift --port 80
or 
sudo forever start app.js --port 80
if you want the game server to start in a forever process that would restart immmediately if the server was to close because of a problem...

You can now try the game if you open your chrome or chromium browser at the address: localhost.
For further steps on how to configure and play games see youtube video or manual.
